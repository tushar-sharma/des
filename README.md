# DES

## About

It is the implementation of DES (only for learning purposes). DES (Data Encryption Standard) is a Symmetrica-key Encryption Algorithm. It is a Block cipher. It encrypts data of 64 bits block with a key of 56 bits (extracted from 64 bits). The same algorithm is used for both encryption and decryption.

## Usage

```bash
# make
```
For encryption
```bash
# ./des -e message key
```
For decryption
```bash
# ./des -d message key
```

Please enter exact 64 bit key.
